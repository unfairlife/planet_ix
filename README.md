# cryptobomb
Tool for Cryptobomb, so I can sleep.

The bot is ready to be used only in my computer, so twist the code around and you'll be able to use it too.
Some stuff need fixing, some new features need to be added.

Based in python 3.9.7, should work in anything below 3.10 and above 3.

- Libs to install(just use pip install): 
  - from PIL.ImageOps import grayscale
  - pyautogui
  - time
  - keyboard
  - numpy
  - random
  - get_window
  - opencv 

- TODO
  - Add a "New map function"
  - Add a reload page based in failed connection
  - Calc energy efficiency based in heroes rarity(make the strong ones crack > leave > common finish > rares come back)
  
  Feel free to change it at will, I just did it for fun in the laziest way possible, someday, when I feel like it, the 
  code readability will be changed, and the ifs deleted. 
  
  Oh, important. 
  
  The code runs based in opencv, so, maybe depending on the colors you use, browser and so on, just take another print from the button and replace mine.
  
  Enjoy.
